/**
 * A SymmetricCipherService instance is an easy to use component which encrypts and decrypts content
 * using a <b>secret key cryptography</b> (symmetric cryptography) algorithm.
 *
 * SymmetricCipherService hides any underlying complexity and only requires the <b>content</b>
 * to encrypt/decrypt and the <b>secret key</b>, regardless of the block mode of operation used.
 * In case the implemented block mode of operation is IV based, then the implementation will
 * generate the IV on the fly and will prefix/read it to/from the output/input.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm">Symmetric-key algorithm</a>
 * @see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher">Block cipher</a>
 * @see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation">Block cipher mode of operation</a>
 *
 * @apiNote Any implementation of this interface <b>must</b> be <b>unconditionally thread-safe</b>.
 * @apiNote
 *    The 'encrypt' and 'decrypt' methods will ensure that the IV (when required)
 *    prefixed/read has identical size and structure, so the output of the 'encrypt' method
 *    can be passed with no alteration into the 'decrypt' method to produce the clear content
 *    (as long as the <b>secret key</b> used is the same)
